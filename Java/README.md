# ☕ Java Folder Structure: `material` vs `studycase` vs `code`

## ✨ Purpose

This folder structure is designed to organize all my Java learning resources effectively. Each folder serves a distinct purpose to support different aspects of studying Java.

---

## 📁 `material/`

### 📌 What's inside?

* Structured and complete Java theory materials.
* Topics are organized like a reference book or lecture note.
* Files typically include:

  * 🧠 Key concepts (e.g., OOP, inheritance, interfaces)
  * ✏️ Syntax explanations
  * 💬 Java-specific tips and notes
  * 📚 Examples with input/output

### 🧠 Goal:

> To build a solid Java knowledge base, well-structured and always ready for review.

---

## 💼 `studycase/`

### 📌 What's inside?

* Mini projects, case studies, or real-world applications using Java.
* Implementations of concepts learned from `material/`.
* Files often include:

  * 🧩 Problem descriptions
  * 🛠️ Full Java code implementation
  * 📄 Documentation or explanation of the solution

### ✨ Style:

* More realistic and project-based.
* Often structured using OOP principles and good coding practices.

### 🧠 Goal:

> To apply Java concepts in a more complex, real-world manner — moving from theory to practice.

---

## 💻 `code/`

### 📌 What's inside?

* Pure practice and hands-on exploration.
* Includes:

  * ✨ Syntax trials
  * 🧪 Experimental classes
  * 🚧 Quick coding tests (e.g., understanding constructors, loops, arrays, etc.)

### ✨ Style:

* Raw and focused on learning-by-doing.
* Files may be minimal or only partially complete — it’s a practice ground.

### 🧠 Goal:

> To explore and strengthen Java fundamentals through active experimentation.

## 📌 Why I Separate Them?

* ✅ `material/`: Learn the theory.
* ✅ `code/`: Practice the building blocks.
* ✅ `studycase/`: Apply everything to realistic Java problems.

"Structure helps focus. That's why I separate what I read 📘, what I try 💻, and what I build 🧩 in Java — so I grow in every direction."
