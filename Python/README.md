# Python Learning Repository Structure 🐍

This document explains the purpose of each folder in this Python learning repository. The structure is designed to separate different kinds of learning content and coding activities.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 1. `material/`

* This folder contains structured learning content.
* Includes topics, explanations, summaries, and markdown-based documentation.
* Acts like a handbook or personal study guide for Python concepts.

### 2. `studycase/`

* Contains learning-by-doing case studies.
* These are specific explorations or challenges meant to deepen understanding of certain topics.
* Each folder in `studycase/` may focus on one problem or technique.

### 3. `code/`

* A playground for quick experiments and syntax practice.
* Useful for testing how something works, prototyping, or running isolated Python snippets.
* Not intended to be polished or structured — more like a scratchpad.
