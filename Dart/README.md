# 🐬 Dart Folder Structure: `material` vs `notes` vs `code`

## ✨ Purpose

In this repository, I separate my Dart learning content into different folders to keep everything organized and purposeful:

---

## 📁 `material/`

### 📌 What's inside?

* Structured and complete Dart study materials.
* Usually based on a syllabus or specific topic.
* Markdown files are designed like full documentation with:

  * 🎯 Definitions
  * ✏️ Syntax explanations
  * 💡 Examples (input/output)
  * 📚 Use cases
  * 🔍 Diagrams or illustrations (if needed)

### 🧠 Goal:

> To serve as a solid, structured Dart learning resource — like your personal handbook or mini textbook.

---

## 📝 `notes/`

### 📌 What's inside?

* Random, messy, or quick notes for understanding Dart.
* Usually contains:

  * ❓ Random questions I ask myself to better understand Dart concepts.
  * 🧩 Tiny experiments or code snippets.
  * 💭 Confusions or realizations while studying.
  * 🛠️ Debugging trials or practice explanations.

### ✨ Style:

* More casual and free-form.
* No need for perfect structure.

### 🧠 Goal:

> To capture my thought process and understanding in real-time — like a Dart learning journal.

---

## 💻 `code/`

### 📌 What's inside?

* Practical coding exercises and hands-on experiments specifically for Dart.
* Files and folders related to:

  * 💡 Learning-by-doing projects
  * 🧪 Syntax testing and error exploration
  * 🚧 Work-in-progress programs or mini projects

### ✨ Style:

* Code-first.
* May or may not be documented — it’s a sandbox for practice.

### 🧠 Goal:

> To apply Dart theory into practice, reinforce understanding, and track growth through real Dart code.

## 📌 Why I Separate Them?

* ✅ `material/`: Clean, polished, ready-to-review anytime.
* ✅ `notes/`: Messy but insightful — it's where I grow and question things.
* ✅ `code/`: My Dart coding playground — where I turn learning into action.

## 💡 Example Scenario:

If I'm learning Dart:

* `material/dart/variables.md` → All about variables, full explanation.
* `notes/dart/why-use-final.md` → My random question: “Why not always use `var` instead of `final`?” with my own reasoning and conclusion.
* `code/dart/variables_demo.dart` → A small Dart program testing different variable declarations.

> "Learning isn't always clean. That's why I separate the polished 📘 from the messy 📝 and the applied 💻 — and all three are important."
